Please read our README.md on the github for the ER diagram information. In addition, you can use combine.sql in our github, which may contain more interesting information (combine.sql here also works). For the function of our project, we have express as clear as we could in the pdf. Regarding the MileStone4, there is no extra information really in this file.
# Blogs #
Our intention is to design a blogging platform, which stores the data of the blog user information, the blog content and comments, the community with topics, subscription information and administration information.

## Aspects ##
For the blog users, they can assess the communities and blogs after login. A new user can create an account by going to the register page. User can check the community list to choose which community to view. After the user chooses a community, the blogs within that community will be displayed. User can follow the community, create new blog, and view the blog details. In a blog detail page, the information of the blog and the information of comments for that blog will be displayed. User can add new comment and delete comment or the whole blog if they are the owner.
For the admins, they can view the statistics on their own page. Admin can ban or unban a user, view the list of community and user, get groups of user based on their following communities, blogs sent, and vip status. Admin can go to a super admin page that they can view any attributes of their choices.

## Application Platform ##
The project will be held on a website. The front-end construction will involve HTML, CSS. We choose to use PHP and Oracle as our database management system. We will use the department Oracle server for SQL.
